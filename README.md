1). Install Node.js and npm:

On the new computer, you'll need to install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

2). Clone the GitHub Repository:

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can proceed to clone your React project's GitHub repository to the new computer. You can use the git clone command to do this. Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository:
